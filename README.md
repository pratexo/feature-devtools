# feature-devtools

This repo contains resources that aim to assist developers with the creation of custom features for the Pratexo Design Studio.
Resources include the following:

* PDF documentation
	* details the steps necessary to setup a local development environment and create a custom feature project
* Feature initialization script
	* creates much of the boilerplate directory structure and files, based on a simple properties file that the developer creates
* Docker Compose file that sets up the Pratexo Feature-Adapter
	* The Feature-Adapter is the liaison between your local feature project and the Pratexo Design Studio
* feature.properties.template file
	* serves as a template for defining the required properties for a custom feature
